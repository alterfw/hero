# Creating models

To create Hero models you need to create a directory named `model` in your theme's root directory.
Inside the `model` folder you can create your model classes extending `AppModel`.

**Note:** Hero needs that the file name match the class name to work properly.

*E.g.*

```php
<?php
// car.php
class Car extends AppModel {

}
```
